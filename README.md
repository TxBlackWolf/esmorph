Esmorph is a work-in-progress library for
[ECMAScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
(also popularly known as [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript>JavaScript))
source modification tool. It is also written in ECMAScript.
Esmorph depends on [Esprima](http://esprima.org).

Esmorph can be used in a web browser:

    <script src="esprima.js"></script>
    <script src="esmorph.js"></script>

or in a Node.js application via the package manager (soon).

    npm install esmorph

Esmorph is still in the development, more info will be available soon.
